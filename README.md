# Preliminary Analysis on the Relationship between Adult ADHD and Brain Connectome Data

**Warning**: This is a repository for the final project of coursework. 
The data published online are synthezied one because of privacy. 
The data provided should be used to help the users understand our codes instead of gaining meaningful analytic results.
Please be careful if you are insterested in our work. 

## Introduction

Recent studies revealed the relationship between adult ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) and brain structures and activities. 
This project aims to explore the feasibility of diagnosing adult ADHD by brain connectome data. 
Meanwhile, we built up baseline models based on census-based taits representing an individual's cognitive abilities, comorbid substance use, demographic information, and health features.

The data used by our project is:

* Response variable: Adult self-reported DSM-5 ADHD Problem Raw Scores (`DSM_Adh_Raw`).
* Brain connectome data:  $68 \times 68$ Structural Connectomes (SC) and Functional Connectomes (FC), and $60 \times 1$ PCA data (TNPCA) of the connectomes.
* Census-based traits: traits measuring an individual's cognition, substance use, psychiatric history, emotion, physical health, and family information.

Due to privacy concern, we did NOT publish the original data but a synthesized data set that contains all the variables required by modeling.

The respository is organized as follows:

```
.
├── README.md
├── renv.lock         # File containing the information of dependencies
├── Code              # Folder containing all the scripts
├── Data              # Folder containning data
│   ├── Checkpoints   # Folder containing the well-trained models
│   └── img           # Folde containing the plots generated by scripts
└── EDA               # Folder containing the RMDs for EDA
```

## Dependencies

In the terminal, run the following command to restore the environment used by our project.
```R
install.packages("renv")
renv::restore()
```

## Replication

To replicate our work, please clone the repository and open `ADHD_Analysis.Rproj` in Rstudio. 
Move to the folder `Code`, and soruce the scripts by their repective numberings (follow the oreder 1->2->3->4). Scripts with the same numbering can be run in any order. 

Here is a brief introduction for each numbering:

* Number 1: The script for processing variables concerning the census-based traits;
* Number 2: The script for processing variables concerning the connectome data;
* Number 3: The scripts for the baseline models;
* Number 4: The scripts for the prediction models based on connectome data.


## Notice

We only uploaded synthesized data because of privacy concerns. Therefore, you are likely to receive meaningless results with the `alldata.rds` under the folder `Data`. 
If you are intrested in how ground-truth models looks like, baseline models trained on the ground-truth data can be accessed at [Checkpoints](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DPx18iJDBTvLGyI8XGyyKb4I2fsiBeqN/view?usp=sharing).
